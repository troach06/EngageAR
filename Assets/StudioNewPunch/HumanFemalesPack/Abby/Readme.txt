Thanks for purchasing our Female Model - Abby!


 Notes:


Model comes with two prefabs, 
AbbyCutOutHair- with a cut out hair, using duplicated hair geometry for the backfaces.


and

AbbyD_sidedHair, using Unity 3D's shader solution from the Blacksmith Demo.
It uses custom shaders to show better hair. But, it needs a script attached to an object inside the hair geometry to work.
In the scene window, it may look sometimes funny(clipping issues etc.) but it works very good when it's in Play mode.

Model has blendshapes for facial expressions, you can access them in GeoMergedGrp/girlBodyUp properties.

They are two types:

BS.MBS_ is for complete facial expressions, like smile, Angry, etc.

BS_BS_ is for control of the individual face parts, like BrowsUp, WinkL etc.


Have fun!
